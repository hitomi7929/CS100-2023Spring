# CS100 2023Spring 计算机编程

&emsp;CS100 introduces programming based on C and the object-oriented C++ programming languages for starting undergraduate students, thus equipping attendees with powerful low-level language knowledge for the efficient implementation of resource-hungry programs.
&emsp;Course slides and homeworks are included in this repository. For the homeworks, the descriptions and my own solutions are accessible. There are some reference solutions and testcases from the TAs for some of the assignments, as well.
